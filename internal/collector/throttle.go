// throttleBits fixes clocks-throttle-reason decode order — map iteration is
// nondeterministic and would make DecodeThrottle's output flaky, the same
// reason sataAttrMetrics (smart.go) is an ordered slice rather than a map.
// Bit values are NVML's nvmlClocksThrottleReasons* mask (nvml.h), ascending.
//
// Design doc §4 names 8 of these 9 bits explicitly (grouping benign vs.
// warning for a *future* throttle→event rule) and doesn't mention 0x8. That
// bit (HwSlowdown) is nonetheless a real, documented NVML throttle-reason
// bit, and v0.1 only exposes the raw decode as a gauge (no bit is dropped
// from decoding) — so it's included here for a complete decode of any mask
// NVML can actually report.
